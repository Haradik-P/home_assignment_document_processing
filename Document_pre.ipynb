      "SCHEDULE A (Attached to and made a part of the Celebrity Endorsement Agreement dated March 14, 2012 by and between Bizzingo, Inc. and Joseph Theismann) I Background Bizzingo expects to populate its Network with Activated Users (as defined herein) through two distinct methods. Method 1. (a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the Network, which will include all or part of the following; business name and address, telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with specific groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as Chambers of Commerce, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member information, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a specific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective user (“Seeded Profile ”). As of the date of this Agreement, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers and associations to provide the basic business information for over 6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo. For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a Seeded Profile is not an “Activated User. ” (b). In order to activate a Seeded Profile, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their Seeded Profile on the Network, and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its Seeded Profile and (ii) claim the Seeded Profile by editing or adding content to the Seeded Profile. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence has been completed by a user, that user will be deemed to be an “Activated User ” and the Network will identify that user as an Activated User. Method 2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the Network. This user will be deemed an Activated User and the Network will identify that user as an “Activated User. ” II Royalty and Initial Bonus 1. Royalty . The Royalty payable under the Agreement shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a Royalty Period determined on the last day of each Royalty Period during the Term. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated User, and by way of example, if on the last day of the first and second Royalty Periods, the Network has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users, respectively, Theismann shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first Royalty Period and an additional 1,000,000 common stock purchase warrants for the second Royalty Period. Each common stock purchase warrant shall enable Theismann to acquire one (1) share of common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years from the end of the applicable Royalty Period. The form of the warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A -l and shall be referred to as the “Royalty Warrant .\" 9 Source: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\n",
      "2. Initial Bonus . Concurrent with the execution hereof, Bizzingo will issue Theismann, as a one time bonus, a common stock purchase warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Bizzingo at a purchase price of $0.15 per share during a term of five (5) years. The form of warrant is attached hereto as Schedule A -II and shall be referred to as the “Bonus Warrant .\" 3. Restrictive Legend . The restricted legend for purposes of any certificate representing the Royalty Warrant and Bonus Warrant, and the stock certificate for shares underlying the Royalty Warrant or Bonus Warrant is as follows: The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\") or any state securities law. These shares have been acquired for investment and may not be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred, nor will any assignee or transferee thereof be recognized by the Company as having any interest in such shares, in the absence of(i) an effective registration statement with respect to the shares under the Act, and any other applicable state law, or (ii) an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company that such shares will be offered for sale, hypothecated, sold or transferred only in a transaction which is exempt under or is otherwise in compliance with the applicable securities laws. *** 10 Source: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, 3/22/2012\n",

WITNESSETH WHEREAS, XIMAGE and MORPHO have signed the \"ForceField PSS Agreement\" for the purchase of services and the use of Software referred to hereafter as the ForceField PSS System. WHEREAS, XIMAGE has granted to MORPHO a perpetual and non-exclusive license, transferable only to the Kuwait Government and solely for use with the PSS to be installed and used as a portrait storage system in connection with the AFIS sold to the Kuwait Government in Kuwait. 1. DEFINITIONS The terms defined in this Section shall have the meaning as follows:\n",
      "FIRST LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means MORPHO will require the Kuwait Government to contact MORPHO maintenance personnel for all problems associated with the installed Force Field PSS System. MORPHO will respond with fixes and/or workarounds to keep the system operational. MORPHO personnel may document any software problems and refer them to XIMAGE for additional fixes or patches. SECOND LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE means if Morpho's personnel can not start or keep the system operational because of software problems, XIMAGE should be contacted to provide all documented and replicated software Errors. XIMAGE will make best efforts to support Morpho by any means available. Such an undertaking is made in the knowledge that a telecommunications line between the site and XIMAGE may not be in existance. PROGRAM means ForceField PSS software developed by XIMAGE including the Sybase and Focus software and includes all software provided under the Maintenance Agreement. PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS means the specifications published by XIMAGE for a particular version of the Program (if no such specification is available, then the relevant documentation for a particular version of the Program). EFFECTIVE DATE shall mean the Date of Installation of the PSS in Kuwait, i.e. December 10, 1993. ERROR means any material failure to operate in accordance with the program specifications delivered from the specifications appended to the base agreement. Error includes malfunctions and defects. Page 3 2. TERM OF AGREEMENT XIMAGE's obligations hereunder shall become effective upon the \"Effective Date\" and, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, shall remain in full force and effect for at least one year thereafter. This Agreement shall automatically renew for consecutive one (1) year terms at XIMAGE's then prevailing rates at the end of each one (1) year term unless either party gives at least sixty (60) days prior written notice of the non-renewal of this Agreement. 3. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICES XIMAGE will provide to MORPHO during the term hereof \"Software Maintenance Services\" which shall include remedial maintenance service (i.e, error fixing and/or work arounds) for any significant error, malfunction or defect (collectively in \"Error\") in the Software so that the Software will operate in accordance with the specifications set forth in the related documentation. Correction of Errors is subject to MORPHO's prompt notification to XIMAGE of the nature and description of the Error provided that the Error is not caused by the abuse, misuse or neglect of the products by MORPHO. In addition, XIMAGE will provide the following as additional Customer Support Services: (a) telephone support as reasonably requested by MORPHO at the rate of $100 per hour for all hours in excess of 40 hours in any one-year term; (b) on-site visits to MORPHO's sites as determined to be necessary by Morpho for Error correction, unless error correction is normally performed via Dial up from the XImage facility in San Jose; (c) give title to all modifications and improvements to the PSS Software which XIMAGE generally makes available to its other customers (at no additional Charge) under standard software maintenance agreements relating to the Software. If MORPHO requests XIMAGE to perform any other services, the related terms and conditions shall be based on further separate agreement between the parties. This Agreement and the rights and duties contained herein are not be deemed to cover maintenance services with respect to hardware. Such may be decided in accordance with paragraph 9. 4. PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES When XIMAGE provides Software Maintenance Services which require the use of the hardware portion of equipment which utilizes the Software (the \"Equipment\"), MORPHO shall make such Equipment available to XIMAGE at and for reasonable times, and in no event will MORPHO charge XIMAGE for such use of such Equipment. All Software Maintenance Services covered by the Maintenance Charges will be performed during the regular business hours of XIMAGE (Monday-Friday, exclusive holidays). If Software Maintenance Services are performed outside regular business hours, MORPHO will pay the additional charges, if any, as at XIMAGES then current charges. Page 4\n",
      "5. CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS AND WARRANTIES The obligations of XIMAGE to provide Software Maintenance Services are subject to MORPHO using the Equipment in accordance with their respective operating manuals and recommended procedures, and causing proper and recommended Equipment Maintenance Services to be performed, including selecting a site which complies with the environmental requirements suggested by the manufacturer of the Equipment or XIMAGE and utilizing appropriate back-up procedures with respect to the Software and data. 6. CHARGES The total annual maintenance charge amounts to US $24502 for the first year of maintenance. MORPHO shall pay all charges under this Agreement, including the total Annual Maintenance Charge, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a valid invoice from XIMAGE.

SECTION 1. SERVICES AS UNDERWRITER Section 1.1 Integrity will act as principal underwriter for the distribution of the Shares covered by the registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information then in effect of the Fund (the “Registration Statement”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore. Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund’s Registration Statement. Section 1.4 Integrity will provide one or more persons during normal business hours to respond to telephone questions concerning the Fund. Section 1.5 Integrity acknowledges that, whenever in the judgment of the Fund’s officers such action is warranted for any reason, including, without limitation, market, economic, or political conditions, those officers may decline to accept any orders for, or make any sales of, the Shares until such time as those officers deem it advisable to accept such orders and to make such sales. Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others. Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such amounts as Integrity shall determine from time to time, as set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Except as may otherwise be determined by Integrity and the Fund from time to time, such commissions or concessions shall be uniform to all dealers. Shares sold to dealers shall be for resale by such dealers only at the public offering price(s) set forth in the Fund’s then current Registration Statement. The price the Fund shall receive for all Shares purchased from the Fund shall be the net asset value used in determining the public offering price applicable to the sale of such Shares.

The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund’s Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan. Section 1.8 Integrity will bear all expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution expenses under this Agreement.

Section 1.9 Integrity shall prepare and deliver reports to the Treasurer of the Fund and to the Investment Adviser on a regular, at least quarterly, basis, showing the distribution expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan and the purposes therefore, as well as any supplemental reports as the Trustees, from time to time, may reasonably request. SECTION 2. DUTIES OF THE FUND Section 2.1 The Fund agrees at its own expense to execute any and all documents, to furnish any and all information, and to take any other actions that may be reasonably necessary in connection with the qualification of the Shares for sale in those states that Integrity may designate.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Section 3.1 The Fund represents to Integrity that all registration statements, prospectuses, and statements of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act with respect to the Shares of the Fund have been carefully prepared in conformity with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. As used in this Agreement, the terms “registration statement,” “prospectus,” and “statement of additional information” shall mean any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC and any amendments and supplements thereto which at any time shall have been filed with the SEC. The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares. Integrity may, but shall not be obligated to, propose from time to time such amendment or amendments to any registration statement and such supplement or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information as, in the light of future developments, may, in the opinion of Integrity’s counsel, be necessary or advisable. If the Fund shall not propose such amendment or amendments and/or supplement or supplements within fifteen days after receipt by the Fund of a written request from Integrity to do so, Integrity may, at its option, terminate this Agreement. The Fund shall not file any amendment to any registration statement or supplement to any prospectus or statement of additional information without giving Integrity reasonable notice thereof in advance; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any way limit the Fund’s right to file at any time such amendments to any registration statement and/or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information, of whatever character, as the Fund may deem advisable, such right being in all respects absolute and unconditional. 3 Source: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n",

AUTOMATIC METER READING Axiometric and LKPL agree to jointly pursue accessing and commercially penetrating the AMR market by developing a suite of qualified and commercially marketable product suites for that market, marketing and selling that suite of products. The following shall be the general roles and responsibilities of the two companies with respect to AMR efforts: 3.1 AMR Products 3.1.1 Water Meter Development: Axiometric and LKPL are jointly developing an AMR product for remote reading of residential water utility meters (hereafter the Water Meter). The Water Meter is a hardware device with integral software. The software includes, under license, the Axiometric wireless mesh networking intellectual property. The Water Meter is capable of interfacing with a variety of water meter registers, recording water usage, logging various exceptional conditions, and reporting them via a radio link. The Water Meter is also capable of forming a mesh network with other Water Meters to extend the radio reporting range using the aforementioned Axiometric mesh networking intellectual property. The Water Meter software and hardware are based on existing Axiometric electric meter AMR hardware and software products; joint ownership of the Water Meter does not convey joint ownership of those existing products or of the mesh networking intellectual property. New software and hardware designs and intellectual property developed in the course of the Water Meter development are jointly owned; specifically, the algorithms used to collect data directly from a Water Meter using a point-to-point link (drive-by data collection), the specific hardware designs related to water register interface, battery power management, and other intellectual property specifically Source: LINK PLUS CORP, 8-K, 8/2/2005\n",

Axiometric has also developed mesh networking intellectual property to allow the meter inserts to relay information from insert to insert thus extending the range and reliability of such information transmissions. Axiometric has also developed a central collection unit (hereafter Mesh Controller or Gateway) capable of collecting usage and other information from a large number of meter inserts and relaying that information onto another communications medium (radio, GSM, etc.) for delivery to a processing system. Axiometric has also developed processing software for recording the collected data to a database, presenting and managing that information, and exporting the data to other processing systems. This collection of products forms an energy metering (electric) AMR Product Suite that is owned by Axiometric. 3.1.3 Axiometric and LKPL may develop other AMR Product Suites (e.g. for gas metering) and ownership of those AMR Product Suites will be held individually by the developer of the suite or jointly if mutually agreed to in writing. 3.2 Marketing and Sales: Regardless of ownership and in order to coordinate marketing and prevent overlap and confusion by customers and potential customers, all sales and marketing shall be conducted as follows: 3.2.1 Axiometric shall have the exclusive right to market and sell AMR Product Suites to entities whose corporate headquarters are physically located in the United States and U.S. territories with the exception of Datamatic as defined in 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 below 3.2.2 LKPL shall have the exclusive right to market and sell AMR Product Suites to Datamatic LTD, a Plano TX corporation (hereafter Datamatic). 3.2.3 LKPL shall have the exclusive right to market and sell AMR Product Suites to entities whose corporate headquarters are physically located outside the United States and its territories. 3.2.4 The proceeds of all sales shall be distributed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as set forth in Section 3.3 [Proceeds] below. 3.3 Proceeds: As a result of the different ownership interests, marketing relationships, and this Agreement, the proceeds of sales of AMR Product Suites shall be as follows unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing: 3.3.1 For sales of Water Meter AMR Product Suites to Datamatic, LKPL shall set the price of Water Meter AMR Product Suite sales to Datamatic.

In the event any person acquires beneficial ownership of voting power in excess of the Threshold as a result of a transaction described in the immediately preceding sentence, the Threshold with respect to such person shall be adjusted to an amount equal to the percentage of beneficial ownership held by such person immediately following such transaction. A party may exercise its right to terminate pursuant to this Section 3 by sending appropriate written notice to the other party. No exercise by a party of its rights under this Section will limit its remedies by reason of the other party's default, the party's rights to exercise any other rights under this Section 3, or any of that party's other rights. Tadeo will maintain accurate books, records and accounts of all transactions relating to the Services performed by it pursuant to this Agreement. Diplomat may, at its own expense, examine and copy those books and records as provided in this Section 4. Such books, records and accounts will be maintained in a manner that allows Diplomat to separate these matters from those relating to Tadeo's other operations. Such books, records and accounts will reflect such information as would normally be examined by an independent accountant in performing an audit pursuant to United States generally accepted auditing standards for the purpose of certifying financial statements, and to permit verification thereof by governmental agencies. Diplomat may make examinations pursuant hereto during Tadeo's usual business hours, and at the place in the continental United States where Tadeo regularly keeps these books and records. Diplomat will be required to notify Tadeo at least five business days before the date of planned examination. If Diplomat's examination is not completed within one month from commencement, Tadeo at any time may require Diplomat to terminate such examination on seven days' notice to Diplomat; PROVIDED that Tadeo has cooperated with Diplomat in the examination of such books and records. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any of Diplomat's directors, officers or employees or any of Tadeo's directors, officers or employees to engage directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as Diplomat or, respectively, or limit or restrict the right of Diplomat or Tadeo as the case may be, to engage in any other business or to render or obtain, as the case may be, services of any kind to or from, as the case may be , any corporation, firm, individual, trust or association.

Tadeo and Diplomat each agree to hold in strict confidence, and to use reasonable efforts to cause each of their employees and representatives to hold in strict confidence, all confidential information concerning Tadeo or Diplomat, as the case may be, furnished to or obtained by the other party, in the course of performing the obligations provided for under this Agreement except to the extent that (a) such information has been in the public domain through no fault of Tadeo or Diplomat, as the case may be, (b) disclosure or release is compelled by judicial or administrative process, or (c) in the opinion of counsel to Tadeo or Diplomat, as the as may be, disclosure or release is necessary pursuant to requirements of law or the requirements of any governmental entity including, without limitation, disclosure requirements under the securities laws of the United States or similar laws of other jurisdictions applicable to Tadeo or Diplomat, as the case may be.

The fees, costs and expenses of such arbitration, as submitted by the AAA, shall be borne equally by both Tadeo and Diplomat; PROVIDED, that each of Tadeo and Diplomat shall pay the fees, costs and expenses of its own counsel, accountants and other representatives in connection with such arbitration. The parameters of the AAA proceedings undertaken in accordance with this Section 8 shall be prescribed such that a decision shall be rendered within sixty (60) days following the initial written reference of the related dispute to AAA arbitration. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 8, in the event that a party against whom any claim, right or cause of action is asserted commences, or has commenced against it, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings, the party or parties asserting such claim, right or cause of action shall have no obligations under this Section 8 and may assert such claim, right or cause of action in the manner and forum it deems appropriate, subject to applicable laws.

RECITALS WHEREAS, Axiometric has developed certain computer software including wireless mesh networking technology and AMR devices and systems. WHEREAS, LKPL has developed certain radio devices and systems along with hardware manufacturing capacities and plans to develop AMR devices and systems. WHEREAS, LKPL and Axiometric believe it will be in their mutual best interests to cooperate in further developing AMR product suites by creating a preferred provider relationship between themselves. WHEREAS, LKPL and Axiometric entered into a Letter of Intent dated May 3, 2005, and now desire to further describe their relationship as initially set forth in the non-binding portions of that Letter of Intent. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the fees to be paid in connection therewith, and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 1. DEFINITIONS 1.1 Throughout this Agreement, and unless the context otherwise requires, the terms shown on Exhibit A (whether or not capitalized) shall have the meanings there specified. If other terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them. 2. OFFICE SPACE 2.1 During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge. 2.2 LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and not needed by LKPL for its own purposes. Axiometric will have access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections, conference room, and printers. 2.3 If LKPL requires space used by Axiometric for LKPL's own purposes, then LKPL will attempt in good faith but without having any obligation to continue to provide Axiometric with comparable space. If LKPL deems itself unable to continue to provide Axiometric work space without expanding LKPL's facilities, and if LKPL determines it will be in its own best interests to expand its facilities, then LKPL will afford Axiometric the opportunity to lease space in the new facilities under a mutually acceptable separate commercial rental agreement. If Axiometric does not then wish to rent office space from LKPL, then LKPL may terminate Axiometric's license to use work space in LKPL's facility upon 60 days notice. 2.4 Axiometric shall be solely responsible for providing all equipment, furniture, supplies and other personal property that Axiometric deems appropriate to operate its business.

Axiometric will use the space at its sole risk. 2.6 Axiometric will have the right to terminate the license to use the office space and to move out of the office space at any time upon two weeks notice. 2.7 Axiometric must at all times use the office space strictly in accordance with terms and conditions stated in LKPL's lease for the space. 2.8 Axiometric must indemnify and hold LKPL and its officers, directors, stockholders, agents, contractors, employees and guests (collectively, the \\\"Indemnified Parties\\\") harmless from and against any and all Loss that the Indemnified Parties may incur arising from or relating to Axiometric use of the office space, including but not limited to any Loss suffered by the Indemnified Parties as a result of any negligent acts or omissions of Axiometric, its employees, agents, contractors and representatives, or anyone else working under Axiometric or in the office with the permission of Axiometric. 3. AUTOMATIC METER READING Axiometric and LKPL agree to jointly pursue accessing and commercially penetrating the AMR market by developing a suite of qualified and commercially marketable product suites for that market, marketing and selling that suite of products. The following shall be the general roles and responsibilities of the two companies with respect to AMR efforts: 3.1 AMR Products 3.1.1 Water Meter Development: Axiometric and LKPL are jointly developing an AMR product for remote reading of residential water utility meters (hereafter the Water Meter). The Water Meter is a hardware device with integral software. The software includes, under license, the Axiometric wireless mesh networking intellectual property. The Water Meter is capable of interfacing with a variety of water meter registers, recording water usage, logging various exceptional conditions, and reporting them via a radio link. The Water Meter is also capable of forming a mesh network with other Water Meters to extend the radio reporting range using the aforementioned Axiometric mesh networking intellectual property. The Water Meter software and hardware are based on existing Axiometric electric meter AMR hardware and software products. Joint ownership of the Water Meter does not convey joint ownership of those existing products or of the mesh networking intellectual property. New software and hardware designs and intellectual property developed in the course of the Water Meter development are jointly owned. Specifically, the algorithms used to collect data directly from a Water Meter using a point-to-point link (drive-by data collection), the specific hardware designs related to water register interface, battery power management, and other intellectual property specifically described and mutually agreed in writing as amendments to this Agreement. Joint ownership conveys to each party individually the right to use, sell, modify, and create derived works from said intellectual property, as well as the right to sub-license these rights to others. 3.1.2 Energy AMR Product Suite: Axiometric has developed an AMR product suite for use in energy (electric) metering consisting of a meter insert for interfacing to energy meters, recording usage and exceptional conditions, and transmitting the information via radio to a central collector. Axiometric has also developed mesh networking intellectual property to allow the meter inserts to relay information from insert to insert thus extending the range and reliability of such information transmissions. Axiometric has also developed a central collection unit (hereafter Mesh Controller or Gateway) capable of collecting usage and other information from a large number of meter inserts and relaying that information onto another communications medium (radio, GSM, etc.) for delivery to a processing system. Axiometric has also developed processing software for recording the collected data to a database, presenting and managing that information, and exporting the data to other processing systems. This collection of products forms an energy metering (electric) AMR Product Suite that is owned by Axiometric. 3.1.3 Axiometric and LKPL may develop other AMR Product Suites (e.g. for gas metering) and ownership of those AMR Product Suites will be held individually by the developer of the suite or jointly if mutually agreed to in writing. 3.2 Marketing and Sales: Regardless of ownership and in order to coordinate marketing and prevent overlap and confusion by customers and potential customers, all sales and marketing shall be conducted as follows: 3.2.1 Axiometric shall have the exclusive right to market and sell AMR Product Suites to entities whose corporate headquarters are physically located in the United States and U.S. territories with the exception of Datamatic as defined in 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 below. 3.2.2 LKPL shall have the exclusive right to market and sell AMR Product Suites to Datamatic LTD, a Plano TX corporation (hereafter Datamatic). 3.2.3 LKPL shall have the exclusive right to market and sell AMR Product Suites to entities whose corporate headquarters are physically located outside the United States and its territories. 3.2.4 The proceeds of all sales shall be distributed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as set forth in Section 3.3 [Proceeds] below. 3.3 Proceeds: As a result of the different ownership interests, marketing relationships, and this Agreement, the proceeds of sales of AMR Product Suites shall be as follows unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing: 3.3.1 For sales of Water Meter AMR Product Suites to Datamatic, LKPL shall set the price of Water Meter AMR Product Suite sales to Datamatic. LKPL shall pay Axiometric the higher of a) five-percent (5%) of the Gross Proceeds or b) twenty-five-percent (25%) of the Net Proceeds of all Water Meter AMR Product Suite sales. 3.3.2 For sales of Electric Meter AMR Product Suites to Datamatic, Axiometric shall set the price of Electric Meter AMR Product Suite sales to Datamatic. LKPL shall pay Axiometric Net Proceeds less the higher of a) five-percent (5%) of the Gross Proceeds or b) twenty-five-percent (25%) of the Net Proceeds. 3.3.3 For sales of AMR Product Suites by LKPL, other than sales to Datamatic as defined above: LKPL shall pay Axiometric the higher of: a) five-percent (5%) of the Gross Proceeds OR b) twenty-percent (25%) of the Net Proceeds 3.3.4 For sales of AMR Product Suites by Axiometric, other than sales to Datamatic as defined above, and other than AMR product suites for use in electric/energy metering: Axiometric shall pay LKPL the higher of: a) five-percent (5%) of the Gross Proceeds OR b) twenty-percent (25%) of the Net Proceeds 3.3.5 Payments to Axiometric for sales of the AMR Product Suite shall be in lieu of any licensed IP Royalty payments for those products. 3.4 Manufacturing: During the term of this Agreement, Axiometric shall issue a Request for Manufacture (RFM) for any AMR hardware to be sold by Axiometric under the terms of this Agreement. The RFM shall specify delivered product cost, credit requirements, delivery schedules, warranty service, quality using industry standard terms, and other industry standard manufacturing requirements. As the preferred manufacturer, LKPL shall have first right of refusal on all such RFMs. If LKPL does not respond to an RFM within thirty (30) days, or cannot provide competitive terms (such as cost, credit, quality, schedule), Axiometric will be free to award the manufacturing contract to an alternate manufacturer. 3.5 Payments: As defined in section 3.3 above, selling parties may owe the other party some portion of the Proceeds. The payment of amounts owed shall be performed as follows: 3.5.1 Payments due shall be made within 45 days of the close of each calendar quarter. 3.5.2 Payments that are not received within thirty (30) days after their due date will bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12.0%) per annum compounded monthly from the due date until such payment is received. 3.5.3 Payments not received within sixty (60) days after their due date will be considered a material breach of this Agreement and the party due payment may pursue any and all legal action to recover the payment and reasonable legal fees incurred in the pursuit of said payment. 3.5.4 Both parties are entitled to reports of sales and to conduct periodic audits to ensure accuracy of Payments as follows: a. Each party will provide to the other a quarterly report (in hard copy and electronic copy (if applicable)) showing the AMR Product Suite sales including the Gross Proceeds and the Production Costs. b. Each party shall have the right to conduct an audit after the end of each calendar year to verify the accuracy of the other party's quarterly reports for that year, provided the audit must be initiated no later than June 30th of each year, and that if no such audit is conducted, then the quarterly reports for that year will be deemed accurate. c. In the event a Payee's audit shows that the Gross Proceeds or Production Costs of the Payor resulted in an under-payment to the Payee, then the Payor shall have the right, at the Payor's cost, to have its own auditor verify the Payee's audit. If the Payor audit confirms the report of the Payee's auditor, then the Payor will pay the deficiency within fifteen (15) days from the time Payee invoices for the deficiency. d. In the event a Payee's audit shows that the Gross Proceeds or Production Costs of the Payor resulted in an under-payment of more than three percent (3.0%) to the Payee, then the Payor shall have the right, at the Payor's cost, to have its own auditor verify the audit. If the Payor audit confirms the report of the Payee's auditor, then the Payor will pay the deficiency and the cost of the Payee's audit within fifteen (15) days from the time Payee invoices for those fees and provides standard proof of the time and expenses incurred. 4.
