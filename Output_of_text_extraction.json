RECITALS WHEREAS, Axiometric has developed certain computer software including wireless mesh networking technology and AMR devices and systems. WHEREAS, LKPL has developed certain radio devices and systems along with hardware manufacturing capacities and plans to develop AMR devices and systems. WHEREAS, LKPL and Axiometric believe it will be in their mutual best interests to cooperate in further developing AMR product suites by creating a preferred provider relationship between themselves. WHEREAS, LKPL and Axiometric entered into a Letter of Intent dated May 3, 2005, and now desire to further describe their relationship as initially set forth in the non-binding portions of that Letter of Intent. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the fees to be paid in connection therewith, and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 1. DEFINITIONS 1.1 Throughout this Agreement, and unless the context otherwise requires, the terms shown on Exhibit A (whether or not capitalized) shall have the meanings there specified. If other terms are defined in the text of this Agreement, then throughout this Agreement, those terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them. 2. OFFICE SPACE 2.1 During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge. 2.2 LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and not needed by LKPL for its own purposes. Axiometric will have access to LKPL's telephone system, internet connections, conference room, and printers. 2.3 If LKPL requires space used by Axiometric for LKPL's own purposes, then LKPL will attempt in good faith but without having any obligation to continue to provide Axiometric with comparable space. If LKPL deems itself unable to continue to provide Axiometric work space without expanding LKPL's facilities, and if LKPL determines it will be in its own best interests to expand its facilities, then LKPL will afford Axiometric the opportunity to lease space in the new facilities under a mutually acceptable separate commercial rental agreement. If Axiometric does not then wish to rent office space from LKPL, then LKPL may terminate Axiometric's license to use work space in LKPL's facility upon 60 days notice. 2.4 Axiometric shall be solely responsible for providing all equipment, furniture, supplies and other personal property that Axiometric deems appropriate to operate its business. LKPL will have no obligation to provide any special facilities or infrastructure unless otherwise negotiated. 2.5 LKPL will have no liability whatsoever for any of Axiometric's equipment, furniture, supplies or other personal property. Axiometric will use the space at its sole risk. 2.6 Axiometric will have the right to terminate the license to use the office space and to move out of the office space at any time upon two weeks notice. 2.7 Axiometric must at all times use the office space strictly in accordance with terms and conditions stated in LKPL's lease for the space. 2.8 Axiometric must indemnify and hold LKPL and its officers, directors, stockholders, agents, contractors, employees and guests (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") harmless from and against any and all Loss that the Indemnified Parties may incur arising from or relating to Axiometric use of the office space, including but not limited to any Loss suffered by the Indemnified Parties as a result of any negligent acts or omissions of Axiometric, its employees, agents, contractors and representatives, or anyone else working under Axiometric or in the office with the permission of Axiometric. 3. AUTOMATIC METER READING Axiometric and LKPL agree to jointly pursue accessing and commercially penetrating the AMR market by developing a suite of qualified and commercially marketable product suites for that market, marketing and selling that suite of products. The following shall be the general roles and responsibilities of the two companies with respect to AMR efforts: 3.1 AMR Products 3.1.1 Water Meter Development: Axiometric and LKPL are jointly developing an AMR product for remote reading of residential water utility meters (hereafter the Water Meter). The Water Meter is a hardware device with integral software. The software includes, under license, the Axiometric wireless mesh networking intellectual property. The Water Meter is capable of interfacing with a variety of water meter registers, recording water usage, logging various exceptional conditions, and reporting them via a radio link. The Water Meter is also capable of forming a mesh network with other Water Meters to extend the radio reporting range using the aforementioned Axiometric mesh networking intellectual property. The Water Meter software and hardware are based on existing Axiometric electric meter AMR hardware and software products. Joint ownership of the Water Meter does not convey joint ownership of those existing products or of the mesh networking intellectual property. New software and hardware designs and intellectual property developed in the course of the Water Meter development are jointly owned. Specifically, the algorithms used to collect data directly from a Water Meter using a point-to-point link (drive-by data collection), the specific hardware designs related to water register interface, battery power management, and other intellectual property specifically described and mutually agreed in writing as amendments to this Agreement. Joint ownership conveys to each party individually the right to use, sell, modify, and create derived works from said intellectual property, as well as the right to sub-license these rights to others. 3.1.2 Energy AMR Product Suite: Axiometric has developed an AMR product suite for use in energy (electric) metering consisting of a meter insert for interfacing to energy meters, recording usage and exceptional conditions, and transmitting the information via radio to a central collector. Axiometric has also developed mesh networking intellectual property to allow the meter inserts to relay information from insert to insert thus extending the range and reliability of such information transmissions. Axiometric has also developed a central collection unit (hereafter Mesh Controller or Gateway) capable of collecting usage and other information from a large number of meter inserts and relaying that information onto another communications medium (radio, GSM, etc.) for delivery to a processing system. Axiometric has also developed processing software for recording the collected data to a database, presenting and managing that information, and exporting the data to other processing systems.
